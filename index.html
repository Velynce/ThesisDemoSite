			Welcome to Gamer Space! In this site will explain more about why I decided to have created this site, and also how the site will be created using different technical software. From my experience in playing online games, and chatting with friends, I have notice a lack of chatting sites for only gamers. I have checked sites only to notice that there are fewer people on those sites and also don't have an authentication for their users. I have only a couple sites that offer authentication, but what they don't have users being able to join another users chatroom, which I have decided to create this site.

		<div id="about">
			<p>
				My site is where gamers, who are new or even
				veteran gamers, come to share their experience
				and discuss currently popular games to games they 
				had enjoyed the most and would recommended. It 
				gives userâ€™s the opportunity to meet new people, and
				to chat among friends. What user's can do is they are 
				able to create a chat where other user's can join, or
				they can create a private where the user can add people
				to that private chat.

			<p>
				When users first enter the site, it will display a
				log in screen which they have the option to either use
				their facebook, or google+ account in order to enter the
				site. When the user logs in they would be taken to
				main page which will display a list of chatrooms that are created
				and also joinable. For private chat, the user has the
				option the invite other's to their chat. They also have 
				the option to create another chat if they don't have the game that they would like to join in. When the user decides the create a chatroom, there will be a form which they will need to fill out. After they have filled the form and submitted, the chat room will be created.
